    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p>Last Updated: 2025</p>

    <p>
        These Terms & Conditions apply to the use of our Inventory Management System (“IMS”).  
        By using this application, you agree to the following terms.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Purpose of the Application</h3>
    <p>
        This IMS is a simple tool for managing user accounts and product inventory.  
        Only <strong>User CRUD</strong> and <strong>Product CRUD</strong> operations are supported.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Authentication</h3>
    <p>
        The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.  
        You are responsible for keeping your token secure.  
        Any action performed using your token is considered your action.
    </p>

    <h3>3. User Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You must provide accurate information during registration.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for any data you create, update, or delete.</li>
        <li>You must not try to access or modify data from another user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Product Management</h3>
    <p>
        You are fully responsible for the product details you add, update, or delete.  
        The application does not automatically verify stock or product accuracy.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Security</h3>
    <p>
        JWT is used to secure user-specific operations.  
        We do not store passwords in plain text.  
        Only hashed passwords are stored in the database.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Data Protection</h3>
    <p>
        We do not share, sell, or transfer your data.  
        Data is used only for operating the User & Product modules of the IMS.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The IMS does not provide backup or recovery features.</li>
        <li>The system may become temporarily unavailable due to hosting limits (e.g., free-tier Render/Netlify).</li>
        <li>No guarantee of real-time sync, automated stock alerts, or advanced features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Changes</h3>
    <p>
        These Terms may be updated if new modules or features are added to the IMS.
    </p>
